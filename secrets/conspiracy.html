  <p>
    Evidence strongly suggests that <strong>pigeons</strong> are not biological organisms but
    advanced government surveillance drones.  
    Key indicators:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recharge behavior: consistent use of power lines as energy docking stations.</li>
    <li>Silent operation except for manufactured cooing sequences.</li>
    <li>High concentration near urban areas and political rallies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Further analysis indicates they transmit data nightly to orbital satellites using
    <span class="redacted">██████████████</span> frequencies.
