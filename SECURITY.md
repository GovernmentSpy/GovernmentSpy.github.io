# Security Policy

Keeping this project secure is a top priority. We appreciate your help in identifying potential vulnerabilities and reporting them responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please **report it privately** to allow us to fix it before it becomes public.

- **u_u@outlook.cz / j__@outlook.cz** 

> Do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Public issues may expose users to risk.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us resolve issues efficiently, please include:

- **Description:** A clear explanation of the issue.  
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed instructions to replicate the problem.  
- **Affected Versions:** Which versions are impacted.  
- **Proof-of-Concept (if possible):** Minimal code or demonstration showing the vulnerability.  
- **Potential Impact:** How serious the issue could be if exploited.

## Our Response Process

We take all security reports seriously. Our typical response process:

1. **Acknowledgment:** Confirm receipt within **48 hours**.  
2. **Assessment:** Investigate and determine the severity of the issue.  
3. **Collaboration:** Work with the reporter to verify and test a fix.  
4. **Resolution:** Release a patch and publicly disclose the vulnerability once fixed. Reporters are credited if they wish.  

We strive to handle all reports efficiently and keep communication transparent throughout the process.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the **latest version** of this project. Older versions may not receive updates, so we encourage upgrading whenever possible.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We follow responsible disclosure best practices to protect users:

- Allow time for the team to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure.  
- Avoid sharing exploit details publicly before a patch is released.  
- Work with the reporter to credit contributions appropriately.

## Security Best Practices

To minimize risks, we recommend:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update libraries and dependencies.  
- **Protect Sensitive Data:** Do not expose API keys, passwords, or private information.  
- **Use HTTPS:** Always encrypt data in transit.  
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks.  
- **Access Control:** Ensure proper authorization and authentication mechanisms.  

Following these practices helps maintain a secure environment for all users.
